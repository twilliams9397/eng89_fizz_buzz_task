# This is the code for the Fizz Buzz task
```python
a = int(input("What number would you like to substitute for Fizz?  ")) # prompts user for two inputs in order the substite for Fizz and Buzz
b = int(input("What number would you like to substitute for Buzz?  "))

for i in range (100): #runs below code loop 100 times
    if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0: # first checks for multiples of a AND b as cannot check this after i has been changed
        i = "FizzBuzz" # substitutes for string and prints the string
        print(i)
    elif i % a == 0: # checks just a
        i = "Fizz"
        print(i)
    elif i % b == 0: # checks just b
        i = "Buzz"
        print(i)
    else:
        print(i) # if no conditions are met it will just print i as the number
